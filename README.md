# Biopsy_Classification

This is a Simple Machine Learning Project to predict the biospy report of the patient by all the other independent variables of the certain person. The Data Cleaning process includes Dealing with Nan values, Detecting and removing these outliers by boxplot, Scaling down the continuous data for better accuracy, and Transforming categorical data. I have used Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and XGB Classifier Classification Algorithms. Then I compared which performed well and achieved an accuracy of 0.98.
